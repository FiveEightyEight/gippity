# Gippity [WIP]

The client side to [Gippity-Serv](https://github.com/FiveEightyEight/gippity-serv). This is a ~~simple~~ wrapper around Openai's ChatGPT (3.5 - 4o mini). The goal is to enable users to build the right assistant for their needs on the fly while making the LLMs responses more reliable.
